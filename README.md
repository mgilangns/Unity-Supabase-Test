# Supabase Unity Template

Template to quickly get started using Supabase with Unity!

For more information on usage and step-by-step details
for how this template was created, check out the
documentation for the [Supabase-CSharp library](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-csharp),
as well as
the [Unity specific documentation](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-csharp/blob/master/Documentation/Unity.md).

From time to time I'm posting videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/changenode) about Supabase and Unity,
